Okay, let's break down this talk (sicha) from the Rebbe. The Rebbe is discussing the unique significance of "Shabbat Bereishit," the very first Shabbat after the joyous holidays of Sukkot and Simchat Torah, when we start reading the Torah cycle anew from the beginning, Genesis ("Bereishit").

**The Core Idea Introduced (Section A): A Foundation for the Year**

The Rebbe starts by reminding us of a well-known teaching from the previous leaders of Chabad-Lubavitch (the "Rebbeim," singular "Rebbe"): **Shabbat Bereishit sets the tone for the entire upcoming year.** The way a person approaches and experiences this specific Shabbat influences how their whole year will unfold.

Think of it like laying the foundation for a building. If the foundation is strong and set correctly, the whole structure built upon it will be sound. Similarly, how we "set ourselves up" (`shtelt zich avek`) spiritually on this first Shabbat has implications for everything that follows.

**The Rebbe's Question: Why *This* Shabbat? (Section A)**

Immediately, the Rebbe probes deeper. This is a classic approach in Chassidic thought – don't just accept a statement, understand *why* it's true. He asks: Why specifically Shabbat Bereishit? What makes *this* Shabbat so foundational?

*   **What about other key moments?** He points out, what about the time of the Giving of the Torah at Mount Sinai (`Matan Torah`), which we commemorate on the holiday of Shavuot? Surely that event, where we received the blueprint for Jewish life, is fundamental to the whole year!
*   **What about other Torah portions?** Furthermore, every week we read a different section of the Torah (`sederah` or `parsha`). Many of these contain unique commandments (`mitzvot`) and concepts that aren't repeated elsewhere. Aren't *all* these portions also relevant and impactful for the entire year?

So, the question is: **What's so uniquely special about Shabbat Bereishit that it, above all others, dictates the spiritual energy and direction for the year ahead?** Why the beginning?

**The Rebbe's Foundational Answer: The Secret of Creation (Section B)**

To answer this, the Rebbe brings in a core principle of Chassidic philosophy, which is rooted in the very first verse of the Torah read on this Shabbat: "Bereishit bara Elokim et hashamayim v'et ha'aretz" – "In the beginning, G-d created the heavens and the earth."

The Rebbe explains that the concept of creation isn't just about something that happened *once*, long ago. The fact that G-d created the entire universe from absolute, complete nothingness (`ayin v'efes hamuchlat`) has a profound ongoing implication.

*   **Creation is Constant:** Because G-d created existence (`yesh`) out of non-existence (`ayin`), that existence doesn't have any inherent power to sustain itself. If G-d were to withdraw His creative energy for even an instant, the entire universe would simply cease to exist, reverting back to nothingness.
*   **A Continuous "Big Bang":** Therefore, the "newness" (`nayes`) or miracle of creation – the bringing forth of something from absolutely nothing – isn't just a historical event. It's happening *right now*, every single moment (`yedeh minut un yedeh rega`). G-d is constantly recreating and sustaining everything in existence.

The Rebbe notes that this idea is explained at length in the foundational text of Chabad Chassidus, the **Tanya** (written by Rabbi Shneur Zalman of Liadi, the first Chabad Rebbe). The Tanya explains the verse (Psalms 119:89) "Forever, O G-d, Your word stands firm in the heavens" (`L'olam Hashem d'varecha nitzav bashamayim`). Chassidus understands "Your word" here refers to the Divine utterances through which G-d created the world (e.g., "Let there be light"). That creative word didn't just speak once; it continuously "stands firm," actively bringing the heavens, the earth, and everything in them into being at every moment.

*   **Reality is Divine:** The conclusion is radical: From its own perspective (`mitzד atzmo`), every created being is *still* essentially nothingness (`ayin v'efes`). Its entire reality, its "is-ness," is *only* the continuous flow of Divine creative energy making it exist right now. So, fundamentally, the existence of the world *is* G-dliness.

**Connecting Creation to the Year's Work (Section C)**

Now the Rebbe connects this back to the initial question about Shabbat Bereishit:

*   **The Core Task:** A central theme in Jewish life, especially emphasized in Chassidus, is transforming the physical world (`gashmiyus`) and our engagement with it (work, daily life) into a "vessel" (`keli`) for G-dliness (`Elokus`). We're meant to infuse the mundane with holiness.
*   **The Perceived Obstacle:** Often, a person might feel that the "natural order" of the world, the demands of material life, make this task difficult, maybe even impossible. The world seems so physical, so separate from G-d.
*   **The Bereishit Solution:** This is where remembering the message of "Bereishit bara" – constant creation – comes in. When a person internalizes that `L'olam Hashem d'varecha nitzav bashamayim` (G-d's word constantly sustains everything), they realize the world *isn't* truly separate or an obstacle.
    *   The Rebbe brings another key concept here, based on a statement from the Zohar (a foundational text of Kabbalah): `Kudsha Brich Hu istakel b'Oraisa u'vara alma` – "The Holy One, Blessed be He, looked into the Torah and created the world." This means the Torah isn't just a history book or law code; it's the Divine blueprint, the very plan and energy G-d used to create and sustain reality. The Ten Utterances of Creation ("Let there be...") are part of this Torah.
    *   **Therefore:** If the *entire existence* of the world is only because of the Torah (G-d's creative word), how can the world possibly be an obstacle *to* fulfilling the Torah? It's a logical contradiction! The same Torah that brings the world into being also contains the commandments, starting with "I am the L-rd your G-d" (`Anochi Hashem Elokecha`) and encompassing all 613 mitzvot.
*   **Practical Impact:** When a person truly grasps this – that the world's reality *is* Torah/G-dliness – it changes their entire perspective and behavior.
    *   Even when walking down the street or involved in business, they can feel connected and find opportunities for holiness – saying a teaching of the Sages (`Ma'amar Chazal`), a chapter of Psalms (`Kapitel Tehillim`), studying Mishna (`Perek Mishnayos`) or Tanya (`Perek Tanya`).
    *   They understand that every good deed has cosmic significance, potentially tipping the scales for the entire world towards merit (`machria es kol ha'olam kulo l'kaf zechus` – a concept from Maimonides).
    *   **Conclusion:** This deep awareness and internalization (`hakarah v'hartifung`) of the meaning of "Bereishit bara" – the constant, Torah-based creation – is what affects *everything* ("the heavens and the earth and all their hosts"), making Shabbat Bereishit the foundation for the entire year's spiritual work. It provides the fundamental perspective needed to navigate life's challenges and fulfill our purpose.

**Beyond the Spiritual: Impact on Material Life (Section D)**

The Rebbe now broadens the scope. The statement that "Shabbat Bereishit affects the whole year" isn't just about our spiritual service (`avodah ruchnis`). It applies to our material well-being too (`gashmiyus`).

*   **The Source of Worry:** Why do people worry about lacking basic needs – often summarized as `Banei, Chayei, U'Mezonei` (children, life/health, and sustenance/livelihood)? The Rebbe, again referencing the Tanya, explains that worry stems from forgetting, even for a moment, that *everything* comes from G-d (`Alles kumt fun Oibershten`).
*   **The Antidote:** When a person constantly remembers the truth of "Bereishit," that G-d is the sole source and sustainer of everything (`L'olam Hashem...`), anxiety dissolves. Why? Because they know G-d is inherently good. As the verse implies (Lamentations 3:38, interpreted Chassidically), "From the Most High, no evil emanates" (`Ma'ito lo teitzei hara'os`), only good (`tov`).
*   **Seeing the Good:** When this deep trust and understanding (`bitachon`) settles in, a person not only believes things are good on some hidden level, but they will eventually come to see the good openly, in a revealed way (`b'tov hanireh v'hanigleh`).

So, the core message of Shabbat Bereishit – recognizing G-d's constant creation and sustenance – empowers us both spiritually (to see the world as compatible with Torah) and materially (to trust G-d for our needs and alleviate worry).

**A Practical Custom and Its Meaning: Aliyot (Section E)**

The Rebbe now connects these ideas to a specific custom practiced on Shabbat Bereishit:

*   **The Custom:** It's common practice in many communities to "sell" or auction off the honors of being called up to the Torah reading (`aliyot`, singular `aliyah`) for the Shabbats throughout the coming year.
*   **The Spiritual Meaning of Aliyah:** What does it mean to "go up" (`oleh`) for an `aliyah`? The Rebbe cites his father-in-law, the Previous Rebbe (Rabbi Yosef Yitzchak Schneersohn), explaining that it's a spiritual ascent. When a person gets an `aliyah`, their soul ascends through its various levels: `Nefesh` (life-force), `Ruach` (spirit/emotion), `Neshamah` (intellect), `Chayah` (living essence), and `Yechidah` (unique singularity). Ultimately, this ascent connects the very essence of the soul (`etzem haneshamah`) with G-d's Essence (`Atzmus Ein Sof Baruch Hu`). It's a profound moment of connection.
*   **Why Bless Even Without Understanding?** The Rebbe addresses a fascinating point of Jewish law (Halacha). Generally, when learning the Oral Torah (Talmud, etc. - `Torah Shebe'al Peh`), one shouldn't make a blessing if they don't understand the meaning. However, for an `aliyah` to the Written Torah (`Torah Shebichtav`), even someone who doesn't understand the Hebrew being read (`am ha'aretz d'la yada mai ka'amar`) makes the blessings before and after. Why? The Rebbe explains: Even if the person doesn't understand consciously *down here* (`l'mata`), their soul, in its higher state of ascent (`l'ma'alah`) during the `aliyah`, *does* understand and connect. This higher connection then draws down (`mamshich`) understanding and blessing to the person *down here*. "Reading (`Mikra`) calls forth and draws down."
*   **Connecting Aliyah to Blessings:** Just as the world is connected to and created through the Torah (`istakel b'Oraisa...`), which is described as the blueprint (`diftra'os u'finkesa'os`), when a Jew connects to the Torah through an `aliyah`, this spiritual connection draws down blessings into the physical world (`gashmiyus`) as well.

So, the custom of securing `aliyot` on Shabbat Bereishit is not just about synagogue honors; it's seen as a way to tap into this deep connection between Torah and creation, drawing down spiritual and material blessings for the entire year.

**Another Practical Action: Increasing Torah Study (Section F)**

The Rebbe extends the principle of "setting the tone" on Shabbat Bereishit to another practical area: personal Torah study.

*   **Building on Tishrei Resolutions:** During the High Holiday month of Tishrei (Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur, Sukkot), people typically make resolutions for the coming year, often including commitments to fixed Torah study times (`kvius l'limud haTorah`).
*   **The Shabbat Bereishit Boost:** The Rebbe encourages everyone, on Shabbat Bereishit itself, to take on an *additional* commitment (`hosafah`) to Torah study for the entire year. This should cover both:
    *   `Nigleh`: The "revealed" parts of Torah (like Talmud and Jewish Law).
    *   `Chassidus`: The "inner," mystical dimension of Torah.
    *   Specifically, the Rebbe suggests including study of the weekly Torah portion through the lens of the classic Chabad texts **Torah Or** and **Likkutei Torah** (discourses by the Alter Rebbe).
*   **Personalized Commitment:** This extra commitment should be made according to one's true, realistic ability (`yicholes`) and be aligned with the needs and inclinations of their individual soul root (`shoresh neshamah`).
*   **The Power of the Commitment:** Making this resolution (`kabbalah`) on Shabbat Bereishit provides the spiritual strength (`koach`) to actually carry it out consistently throughout the year, making the effort easier later on (`farshpart men a sach tircha`). And, like the other aspects, this commitment to Torah study also draws down material blessings: `Banei, Chayei, U'Mezonei Ru'vichei` (children, life, and *abundant* sustenance).
*   **The Summary:** The Rebbe concisely summarizes this point: Everyone should take upon themselves an additional study session, both in `Nigleh` and `Chassidus`.

**Connecting to the Upcoming Month: Shabbat Mevarchim MarCheshvan (Section G)**

The Rebbe concludes by connecting the themes to the specific timing of this particular Shabbat – it's also "Shabbat Mevarchim," the Shabbat when we bless the upcoming new month, which is MarCheshvan.

*   **The Month of MarCheshvan:** Why is the month called *Mar*Cheshvan? One reason relates to it being the start of the rainy season (`unat geshamim`). "Mar" can mean "drop" or "water." (It also famously means "bitter" because it has no holidays, unlike the preceding month of Tishrei).
*   **Dew vs. Rain (Spiritual Analogy):** Chassidus explains a difference between `Tal` (dew) and `Matar` (rain):
    *   `Tal` (Dew): Represents Divine blessing that comes from Above (`itarusa d'l'eila` - arousal from Above) without necessarily requiring intense human effort. Dew descends every night regardless of our actions (`Tal lo mi'atzer` - Dew never ceases, Talmud Taanit 3a). It's associated with the summer.
    *   `Matar` (Rain): Represents blessings that are drawn down through human effort, prayer, and good deeds (`itarusa d'l'tata` - arousal from Below). We need to pray for rain; it depends more on our actions. It's associated with the winter, which is spiritually considered a time requiring more effort.
*   **Summer vs. Winter (Spiritual Climate):** The Rebbe explains this analogy further:
    *   Summer: Spiritually easier. G-d's light and blessing shine more readily, like the physical sun (`Shemesh u'magen Havayeh Elokim` - "For the L-rd G-d is a sun and a shield," Ps. 84:12). The Rebbe quotes the Previous Rebbe saying spiritual work (`avodas Hashem`) is easier in the summer.
    *   Winter: Spiritually requires more effort from our side (`itarusa d'l'tata`). The Divine light is more concealed, like the weaker winter sun.
*   **The Power of Shabbat Mevarchim:** This Shabbat Mevarchim MarCheshvan occurs right at the end of Tishrei. Tishrei is called `HaChodesh HaShvii ha'musba b'chol` – "the seventh month (counting from Nisan) which is saturated with everything" (holiness, blessings from all the holidays). Because this Shabbat partakes of Tishrei's abundant holiness, it gives us the spiritual power (`nesinas koach`) needed for the more challenging work (`avodah`) of MarCheshvan and the winter months ahead – the work that relies on our initiative (`itarusa d'l'tata`).
*   **Drawing Down Blessings:** When we engage in this "winter work," empowered by the strength received on Shabbat Mevarchim MarCheshvan (which itself is rooted in Shabbat Bereishit and Tishrei), we draw down blessings for the entire year, both materially (`b'gashmiyus`) and spiritually (`b'ruchniyus`).

**In Essence:**

The Rebbe explains that Shabbat Bereishit is uniquely foundational because it grounds us in the reality of constant creation through G-d's word (Torah). Internalizing this truth empowers us to see the world not as an obstacle but as a vehicle for holiness, alleviating spiritual struggles and material worries. This foundational perspective, set on Shabbat Bereishit, influences the entire year. The Rebbe encourages practical expressions of this: appreciating the spiritual depth of `aliyot`, and crucially, taking on an extra commitment to Torah study (`Nigleh` and `Chassidus`) for the year. Finally, he connects this to the specific blessing of the upcoming month of MarCheshvan, showing how the spiritual "saturation" of Tishrei, experienced on this Shabbat, gives us the strength needed for the challenges and opportunities of the coming season.
